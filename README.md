# traj-opt-ctrl
A small trajectory optimization and closed loop control library along with supporting libraries for animation and derivation of equations of motion

This code is in a state of constant flux as I experiment, and I never have time to adquately document or comment it, so I wouldn't recommend it for 3rd party use. It may be of interest to those trying to do something similar, though if you're studying this topic I'd highly recommend checking out Matthew Kelly's writing and code at http://www.matthewpeterkelly.com.
