Single pendulum cart v3
Attempt to re-frame the problem with cart acceleration as input. 1-parameter viscous damping for joint friction.

Call in this order - 

derive_eom.m - derive the equations of motion
pendulum_test - pokes the model, animates, controls real system to match nominal
single_pendulum_cart_friction_main.m - generate swingup trajectories
